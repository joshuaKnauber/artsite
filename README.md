## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need a planetscale database, Clerk for auth (you can take that out manually too), Uploadthing for image uploads, twicpic for image optimization (optional but the twic components are being used in the code base)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
